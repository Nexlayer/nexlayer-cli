# Nexlayer CLI Refactoring Documentation

This directory contains documentation for the Nexlayer CLI refactoring project. The goal of this project is to eliminate redundancies, improve maintainability, and create a more robust and consistent codebase.

## Documentation Structure

- [Master Plan](./master-plan.md): Comprehensive plan for the entire refactoring process
- [Phase 1: Analysis](./phase1-analysis.md): Analysis of the current state of the codebase
- [Phase 2: YAML Schema Validation](./phase2-schema-validation.md): Plan for consolidating YAML schema validation
- [Phase 3: API Client](./phase3-api-client.md): Plan for consolidating API client implementation
- [Phase 4: Configuration Loading](./phase4-config-loading.md): Plan for consolidating configuration loading
- [Phase 5: Template Variables](./phase5-template-vars.md): Plan for consolidating template variable processing
- [Phase 6: API Documentation](./phase6-api-docs.md): Plan for consolidating API reference documentation

## Refactoring Phases

The refactoring is divided into six phases, each focusing on a specific area of the codebase:

1. **Analysis and Preparation**: Analyze the current state of the codebase, identify redundancies, and prepare for refactoring.
2. **YAML Schema Validation Consolidation**: Create a unified schema definition and validation approach.
3. **API Client Consolidation**: Define a unified API client interface and standardize error handling.
4. **Configuration Loading Consolidation**: Create a unified configuration package and implement project detection.
5. **Template Variable Processing Consolidation**: Create a unified variables package and implement variable registry.
6. **API Reference Documentation Consolidation**: Define documentation standards and implement OpenAPI specification.

## Implementation Strategy

The refactoring follows a feature branch strategy:

1. Create a main refactoring branch: `refactor/main`
2. Create feature branches for each phase:
   - `refactor/phase1-preparation`
   - `refactor/schema-validation`
   - `refactor/api-client`
   - `refactor/config-loading`
   - `refactor/template-vars`
   - `refactor/api-docs`
3. Merge feature branches into the main refactoring branch
4. Merge the main refactoring branch into `main` after all phases are complete

## Contributing

When contributing to the refactoring project, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Branch from the appropriate feature branch**: Each phase has its own feature branch. Make sure to branch from the appropriate feature branch for your changes.
2. **Follow the refactoring plan**: Each phase has a detailed plan. Make sure your changes align with the plan.
3. **Add comprehensive tests**: All changes should be accompanied by comprehensive tests.
4. **Update documentation**: Update the documentation to reflect your changes.
5. **Ensure backward compatibility**: All changes should maintain backward compatibility unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## Progress Tracking

The progress of the refactoring project is tracked in the following ways:

1. **GitHub Issues**: Each phase has a corresponding GitHub issue that tracks the progress of the phase.
2. **Pull Requests**: Each feature branch has a corresponding pull request that tracks the changes made in the phase.
3. **Documentation Updates**: The documentation is updated as the refactoring progresses to reflect the current state of the codebase.

## Timeline

The entire refactoring process is expected to take 6-12 weeks, depending on the complexity of each phase and the availability of resources. See the [Master Plan](./master-plan.md) for a detailed timeline.
