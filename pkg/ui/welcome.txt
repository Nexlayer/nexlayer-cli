🚀 Welcome to Nexlayer CLI!

Let's get you set up with everything you need.

📝 To get started, you'll need an authentication token.
You can get your token by visiting: https://app.nexlayer.io/settings/tokens

Once you have your token, set it in your environment:

export NEXLAYER_TOKEN=your_token_here

Pro tip: Add this to your shell configuration file (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.)
to make it permanent.

🎉 Next steps:
1. Run 'nexlayer init my-app' to create a new project
2. Or use 'nexlayer deploy' to deploy an existing project

💡 Development workflow:
- Use 'nexlayer watch' to auto-redeploy on changes
- Use 'nexlayer status' to check deployment status
- Use 'nexlayer logs' to view application logs
